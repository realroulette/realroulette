Modern cryptographic algorithm such as SHA256 is used to achieve that.</p><p>A server hash is provided by MoneyPot(computed with the formula SHA256(secret + "|" + salt) where secret is the server seed(a value between 0 and (2^32)-1) and salt is the value added to prevent bruteforce. The client then provides a client seed(between 0 and (2^32)-1 which can be changed manually by the users). </p><p>The final bet outcome is then calculated through the formula (ServerSeed + ClientSeed) % Math.pow(2,32). Although we automatically verify each bet made to MoneyPot, the user can also verify each bet manually with all the information provided to ensure that the outcome is fair</p></div></div>
